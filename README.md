# **🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in C**

## **📌 Overview**  
This repository contains a well-structured **Binary Search Tree (BST)** implementation in **C**, designed with modular programming principles. It includes various operations such as insertion, traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder), deletion, and counting nodes with different properties.


## **📂 Project Structure**
Binary_Search_Tree-with-C/
│── bst.h         # Header file containing function prototypes and structure definition
│── bst.c         # Implementation of BST functions
│── bst_main.c    # Main program to interact with BST
│── README.md     # Documentation
│── .gitignore    # (Optional) Specifies ignored files, e.g., executables

## **🚀 Features**
✔ Insert a node into BST  
✔ Perform **Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder** traversal  
✔ Count **total number of nodes**  
✔ Count nodes with **one child** and **two children**  
✔ Find nodes with a **common parent**  
✔ Delete a node from BST
